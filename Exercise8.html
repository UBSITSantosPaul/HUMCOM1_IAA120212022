            <p style="text-indent:35px; text-align:justify">The seventeen year-old Hazel Grace has lung cancer and needs to carry an oxygen 
                tank wherever she goes. Her mother Frannie encourages her to go to a cancer support group against her will. However, when 
                Hazel meets the eighteen year-old Gus, who lost part of one leg with cancer but apparently is cured, they fall in love with 
                each other. Hazel introduces her favorite novel to Gus and tells that she dreams of having a conversation with the author, 
                Peter Van Houten, who lives in Amsterdam, about the ending of the novel. Gus contacts him through his assistant, and Van 
                Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam. They travel to The Netherlands with Frannie where Hazel will learn that Peter 
                Van Houten is not like they expected at all.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:35px; text-align:justify">Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted 
                from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, 
                Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help 
                advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues 
                in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on 
                how best to navigate a new city, house and school.</p>

                first time. He's a bit uneasy about how they'll treat him, as they're white and he's black. However, her parents turn out to be 
                unfazed and everything seems to be going fine. Chris then starts to notice some weird behavioral traits with the African-American 
                staff at the house. The Armitages throw a huge party and Chris ends up in some awkward conversations with the guests. Initially, 
                he just puts it down to the racial difference, but then the guests', and Armitages', motives start to appear more sinister. Chris 
                decides it is time to get out.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:35px; text-align:justify">Peter Parker (Garfield) is an outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as 
                a boy, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field). Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who 
                he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone), 
                and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, 
                he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), 
                his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering 
                choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:35px; text-align:justify">After the invasion of fortress Europe on June 6th 1944, Cpt. Miller leads his squad from the 
                2nd Ranger Battalion of the 29th Infantry Division, on a mission to find and bring home Private James Francis Ryan after the death of his 
                brothers. The mission takes them through Nazi occupied territory to establish contact with Ryan's unit, an element of the 101st Airborne 
                Division. This exciting war thriller brings the reality of history's bloodiest war into the homes of ordinary people, but also brings to 
                light the reality of broken and lost families in a time of total and encompassing war.</p>
