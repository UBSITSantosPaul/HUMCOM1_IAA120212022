            <p>“Doping” refers to the use of banned substances in competitive sports. Performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) is another 
                term used to for drugs used by athletes to improve their athletic performance.</p>

            <p>Regular physical activity is good for your body, reducing the risk that you'll develop high blood pressure, heart disease, 
                colon cancer or diabetes. Exercise is also good for your mind. Regular activity can reduce stress, anxiety and depression. 
                Plus, staying active helps people maintain their strength, flexibility and endurance as they age.</p>

    <h2>Why is Doping such a Big Deal?</h2>    
        <p><strong>Safety first! The most important reason doping is a big deal is the fact that many of these substances can have harmful and long-lasting 
            side effects which may include the following:</strong><br>
            <br>
            Cardiovascular: irregular heart rhythm, elevated blood pressure, heart attack, sudden death<br>
            <br>
            Central Nervous System: insomnia, anxiousness, depression, aggressive behavior, suicide, headache, addiction with withdrawal, psychosis, 
            tremor, dizziness, stroke<br>
            <br>
            Respiratory: nose bleeds, sinusitis<br>
            <br>
            Hormonal: infertility, gynecomastia (enlarged breasts), decreased testicular size, low sex drive, acromegaly (coarse bones in face, hands, 
            and feet), cancer<br>
            <br>
            The second issue is more of a moral dilemma. These banned substances are used to gain an unfair advantage which significantly devalues the 
            spirit of competition.<br>
            <br>
            As stated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the purpose of an anti-doping program is “to protect the athletes' fundamental right to 
            participate in doping-free sport and thus promote health, fairness and equality for athletes worldwide…”<br></p>

    <h2>What Substances are Banned from Use?</h2>    
        <p><strong>In general, the following classes of drugs are banned: Street drugs, stimulants, anabolic steroids, peptide hormones (i.e. human 
            growth hormone [hGH]), alcohol and beta blockers (for archery and rifle shooting only), diuretics, beta-2 agonists, anti-estrogens, blood 
            doping, and gene manipulation.</strong><br></p>
            <br>
            <aside>
            <p>Did you Know?<br>
                The U.S. is still the world's largest market for medical devices, machines, and equipment with a 
                $156 billion market share in 2017.<br>
                <br>
                By 2023, the industry is expected to increase its market share to $208 billion.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>For athletes who need a banned drug for legitimate medical reasons, the anti-doping programs offer a way to request a therapeutic use of 
            exemption (TUE) so the athlete can use the drug. The athlete must have a physician complete a TUE form that states the athlete needs the 
            drug to treat their medical condition and that an alternative non-banned drug is not available or insufficiently treats their condition. 
            The TUE is reviewed by a medical committee, which either allows the athlete to take the drug or denies the athlete's request<br>
            <br>
            It is important to note that even some over-the-counter (OTC) medications and supplements are either banned or contain banned additives or 
            contaminants. For example, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bans excessive caffeine use, defined as a urine caffeine level 
            above 15μg/ mL. WADA has banned pseudoephedrine (i.e. Sudafed) if the urine concentration is above 150 mcg/ml, although this drug is allowed 
            by the NCAA. There are many other examples of commonly used drugs that may be permitted by one group and disallowed by another. In any case, 
            the athlete should work closely with the supervising medical team to determine which drugs are safe and permitted for use.<br>
