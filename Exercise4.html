            <article><strong><span style= "color: rgb(0, 73, 182)">The Philippine Eagle, as its name suggests, is found only in the Philippines</span></strong>, 
                an island country in Southeast Asia. While the Philippines consists of more than 7,000 islands, the Philippine Eagle is found on only four of them, 
                all within the northern and eastern regions of the country.</article>

            <article>Apart from being one of the largest eagles in the world, it could be argued that the Philippine Eagle is also one of the most striking. It has 
                a massive dark black bill with a tinge of blue, neon yellow feet, and pale gray-blue eyes. Its cottony white belly contrasts with its darker back, 
                and the fringe-like feathers on its legs match the long brown feathers that adorn its head and the back of its neck.</article>

                <article><strong><span style= "color: rgb(0, 73, 182)">Philippine Eagles are diurnal</span></strong>, which means they hunt, fly, build nests, participate in courtship activities and otherwise go about their business 
                    during daytime hours. They rest at night. <strong><span style= "color: rgb(0, 73, 182)">Despite their large size, these eagles tend to be fast and agile in the air, which helps make them very successful hunters.</span></strong></article>

            <article><strong><span style= "color: rgb(0, 73, 182)">Philippine Eagles engage in a number of hunting strategies to score a meal</span></strong>. Sometimes they simply sit and wait until prey is spotted, or they fly from perch to perch through the canopy. They have also been known 
                to probe dense tangles and knotholes in trees in search of something tasty to eat.</article>
