            <h3>Chicago Bulls Dynasty</h3>
            <br>
            <section>
                The Chicago Bulls joined the NBA for the 1966-67 season. The franchise struggled for the better part of a quarter century, occasionally 
                putting excellent teams on the court, such as the tough units of the mid-1970s that featured Bob Love, Norm Van Lier, Jerry Sloan, and 
                Tom Boerwinkle. More often, however, the Bulls worked hard for mediocre results. That all changed in the mid-1980s with the drafting of 
                Michael Jordan, the dominant player of his era and possibly the greatest player of all time.

                Jordan won seven straight scoring titles with a combination of breathtaking slam dunks and a bag of thrilling shot-making tricks. He put 
                up some of the biggest numbers in NBA history and wrote some of the most memorable chapters in the annals of the league. The addition of 
                Scottie Pippen, another Hall of Famer, in 1987 would set the stage for one of sport's great dynasties.

                In the early 1990s, the Bulls assembled a strong supporting cast for Jordan and Pippen which won three consecutive NBA titles, becoming 
                only the third franchise in history to string together a trio of crowns. After more than a year of "retirement" to try his hand at professional 
                baseball, Jordan returned to lead the Bulls back to another title in 1996, one more in 1997 and a third in a row in 1998, the Bulls' second 
                three-peat of the decade and their sixth NBA championship trophy.

                Ten years later, Chicago beat overwhelming odds to win the NBA Draft Lottery, meaning the Bulls had the top pick in the 2008 NBA Draft. Point 
                guard Derrick Rose was the team's choice, and he has since led the Bulls to the playoffs in each of his professional campaigns, including a 
                trip to the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals. In Rose's third season, he became the youngest player in NBA history to earn MVP honors.

                Prior to the inception of the Bulls organization, two pro teams had failed in Chicago. One squad, the Stags, had been a charter member of the 
                11-team Basketball Association of America, the predecessor of the NBA. The franchise folded after the 1949-50 campaign. The Packers debuted in 
                1961-62, but after two last-place finishes and a name change to the Zephyrs, the franchise moved to Baltimore and eventually became the Washington 
                Bullets.

            <h3>Los Angeles Lakers In The 2020 NBA Finals</h3>
            <br>
            <section>
                The 2020 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association 2019-20 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In 
                this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat, 4-2, winning 
                their first NBA championship in ten years. It was the franchise's 17th title, tying the Boston Celtics for the most in the league's history. The Lakers' 
                LeBron James was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the fourth time in his career. He became the first player in league history to be 
                named Finals MVP with three different franchises.

            <section>
                The Lakers were the No. 1 seed in the West, while the Heat was No. 5 in the East, becoming the third-lowest seed to advance to the Finals. This was the 
                first NBA Finals matchup between the two teams and the first time that Finals participants had both missed the playoffs in the previous season. James had 
                previously played with Miami under Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra, winning back-to-back NBA titles in 2012 and 2013 in four consecutive Finals appearances 
                from 2011 to 2014, while Heat president Pat Riley was head coach of the “Showtime”-era Lakers from 1981 to 1990 leading them to four NBA titles in seven 
                Finals appearances. For the first time in six seasons, the Golden State Warriors were not in the Finals.

                The Finals were originally scheduled to begin on June 4 and end on June 24, but the season was suspended on March 11 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NBA and 
                its players later approved a plan to restart the season in late July, setting up the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World to protect teams from the virus. The games 
                were played behind closed doors in the Bubble at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Bay Lake, Florida, with the Finals being played from September 30 through 
                October 11. This year's Finals were the latest to begin (beating the 2014 edition which began on June 5) and the first one played in September and October.

            <h3>Boston Celtic's Legend Larry Bird</h3>
            <br>
            <section>
                There are many Celtics Legends, but there is only one man whose nickname actually is Legend. Larry Bird might be the most well-known Celtics player of all-time, 
                and his incredible career led to him being dubbed with an iconic nickname: Larry Legend.

            <section>
                Bird's legend began long before he arrived in Boston. He was born on Dec. 7, 1956 in West Baden, Ind. Located in the southwest portion of Indiana, West Baden and nearby 
                French Lick were the cities where Bird turned himself from a young boy into a basketball phenom. He attended Spring Valley High School and experienced successs from the 
                very beginning. Legend has it that Bird would use every minute of his down time, including time between classes, to practice his skills in the school's gymnasium. That work 
                ethic helped him become the school's all-time leading scorer. It also drew much attention from the collegiate level, where Bird was sought after as a top-level recruit.

            <section>
                Boston became Bird's home away from home. He donned green and white for all 13 of his NBA seasons and became one of the greatest professional basketball players of all time. 
                His success in the NBA began immediately. Bird averaged 21.3 PPG and 10.4 RPG during his rookie season, helping to lead the Celtics to a 61-21 record in 1979-80. The 61 wins 
                were 32 more than the Celtics accumulated during the prior season. One season later, Bird put up 21.2 PPG, 10.9 RPG and 5.5 APG and helped Boston win its first NBA championship 
                since 1976.

                The 1981 World Championship was the first of three that Bird would win during his illustrious career. The final two, obtained in 1984 and 1986, featured Finals MVP performances 
                by Bird. He averaged 27.4 PPG and 14.0 RPG during the 1984 Finals victory over the Los Angeles Lakers and 24.0 PPG, 9.7 RPG and 9.5 APG during the 1986 victory over the Houston Rockets.
